# WordMap

[中文版本 README available here](README.zh.md)

This project is a **Python tool** designed to help you query word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences using the Wordnik API. The results are saved in a local JSON file, categorized by date. Additionally, the tool can convert the saved JSON data into **Markmap**-formatted Markdown files, allowing you to visualize your word learning progress in the form of interactive mind maps.

## Features
- **Wordnik API Queries**: Retrieve word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and example sentences using the Wordnik API.
- **Daily Progress Recording**: Save query results in a local JSON file, organized by date.
- **Markmap Conversion**: Convert stored JSON data into Markmap-friendly Markdown format.
- **Visualization**: Use the Markmap tool to view word data as interactive mind maps.

## Get a Wordnik API Key
To get a Wordnik API key, you need to sign up for a Wordnik developer account and create an API key. Here are the detailed steps:

1. Visit the [Wordnik developer website](https://developer.wordnik.com)
2. Sign up or log in to an account
3. Create an API key
    - Click My Account or API Key in the navigation bar.
    - Select Create an API Key or similar.
    - Fill in the relevant information for your API key:
    - Name: Give your API key a name (e.g. My Python App).
    - Description: Briefly describe the purpose of the key (e.g. Word lookup for my app).
    - API Access Level: You can usually choose the default permissions.
    - Click Submit or Create Key.

4. View and save the API key
    - Once generated, the page will display your API Key.
    - IMPORTANT: Keep this key safe! You can copy and paste it somewhere safe (e.g. a password manager or environment variable in your code).

5. Using API Key
    ```bash
    # Enter your Wordnik API key
    API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
    ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yzwbeast/word-to-markmap.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd word-to-markmap
   ```

<summary>Why Use Virtual Environments</summary>

> When you encounter the "**externally-managed-environment**" error, it might be because the Python version installed via APT by the operating system enforces strict management of the system environment, preventing users from modifying system-level Python packages with pip.<br />
> **Recommended Solution**:<br />Using a virtual environment is the cleanest and safest method. It does not affect the system Python environment and allows you to freely manage dependencies.
</details>

3. Create a virtual environment<br />Run in the project directory:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv map
   ```
   - `map` is the name of the virtual environment and can be replaced with any name.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source map/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
6. Run the word query script:
   ```bash
   python word_query.py
   ```

## Usage
1.	Run `word_query.py` to query a word from the Wordnik API and save the results to a JSON file.
2.	Use `json_to_markmap.py` to convert the saved JSON data into Markmap Markdown format.
3.	View the generated Markdown file in the Markmap tool to visualize your word learning progress.

## File Structure
- `word_query.py`: The main script for querying words and saving the results to a JSON file.
- `json_to_markmap.py`: The script for converting the saved JSON file into Markmap format.
- `word_queries.json`: JSON file storing the queried word data, categorized by date (generated by `word_query.py`).

## Example

The Markmap Markdown output for a queried word might look like this:
```bash
---
title: Word Queries
markmap:
  colorFreezeLevel: 2
  maxWidth: 300
  initialExpandLevel: 2
---

# Word Queries

### example
- **Definitions**:
  - noun: A representative form or pattern.
- **Synonyms**: model, exemplar
- **Antonyms**: counterexample
- **Examples**:
  - This is an example sentence.
```
Import the generated Markdown file into Markmap to see a visual representation of the word and its data.
